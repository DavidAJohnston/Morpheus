# Open Issues:

## Blockchain Gas Fees
## 1. How to pay for gas fees of the end user without adding complexity? 
One answer is to have developers use a part of the ETH generated from yield activities to pay for the user's transaction fees via abstraction or gas station type set up.

## 2. How should ETH fees paid to Compute providers flow?
Example: 
- A. User pays fee in the base currency of the smart contract (i.e. x% of transaction value, paid in ETH).
- B. The executing compute provider receives the fee directly. This is a fee for work performed.â€¨
- C. Compute provider is only directed compute requests in proportion to amount of MTN staked.
